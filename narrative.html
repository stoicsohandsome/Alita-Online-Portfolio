        <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Marc Kenneth Alita</strong>, a <span>BS Computer Engineering - 1</span> student at the <span>University of Bohol</span>.</p>

            I’ve always been someone who embraces challenges and values growth. One of my most memorable experiences 
            was being the captain of my <span class="highlight">Mobile Legends</span> team. Every time my friends and I created a team, 
            they chose me as the leader because of my communication and leadership skills. Together, we competed in countless tournaments 
            and achieved numerous victories. These experiences not only taught me the value of teamwork and strategy but also strengthened 
            my confidence in leading others.
        </p1>
        <blockquote>
            "Leadership isn’t about authority; it’s about responsibility and inspiration."
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p2>
            I’ve also been deeply involved in my faith community for many years. I served as an altar server for nine years, 
            which helped me develop strong discipline and a deep sense of spirituality. Eventually, I became the president 
            of the altar servers in our parish, where I had the opportunity to guide and inspire others. Currently, I serve 
            as the vice president of our chapel. My role goes beyond leadership—I’ve designed our organization’s t-shirts 
            and created posters for events, making sure every detail represents our mission and values. These creative contributions 
            have been incredibly fulfilling and meaningful for me.
        </p2>
        <p class="tagline">"Creativity fuels my connection to the community."</p>

        <p3>
            On a personal level, I consider myself a friendly and kind person who values independence and resilience. 
            Last semester, during a group programming project, I faced the challenge of working with unmotivated teammates 
            and limited resources. Despite not having a laptop and receiving little help from my group, I took responsibility 
            and completed the project on my own. It was a difficult yet rewarding experience that reinforced my strong mindset 
            and determination.
        </p3>

        </blockquote>
        <p4>Whether it’s leading a team, contributing to my community, or overcoming personal challenges, I’ve learned that 
        <span>hard work</span>, <span>kindness</span>, and <span>faith</span> can help me succeed in any endeavor.</p4>
