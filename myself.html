            <p style="font-size:1em; line-height:1.6; margin:10px 0;">Hi! I’m <span style="color:#007BFF; font-weight:bold;">Marc Kenneth Alita</span>, a BS Computer Engineering - 1 student at the University of Bohol.</p>
            <p style="font-size:1em; line-height:1.6; margin:10px 0;">I’ve always been someone who embraces challenges and values growth. One of my most memorable experiences was being the captain of my <span style="color:#007BFF; font-weight:bold;">Mobile Legends</span> team. Every time my friends and I created a team, they chose me as the leader because of my communication and leadership skills. Together, we competed in countless tournaments and achieved numerous victories. These experiences not only taught me the value of teamwork and strategy but also strengthened my confidence in leading others.</p>

        <section style="background-color:#fff; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; margin-bottom:20px; box-shadow:0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
            <p style="font-size:1em; line-height:1.6; margin:10px 0;">I’ve also been deeply involved in my faith community for many years. I served as an altar server for nine years, which helped me develop strong discipline and a deep sense of spirituality. Eventually, I became the president of the altar servers in our parish, where I had the opportunity to guide and inspire others. Currently, I serve as the vice president of our chapel. My role goes beyond leadership—I’ve designed our organization’s t-shirts and created posters for events, making sure every detail represents our mission and values. These creative contributions have been incredibly fulfilling and meaningful for me.</p>

            <p style="font-size:1em; line-height:1.6; margin:10px 0;">On a personal level, I consider myself a friendly and kind person who values independence and resilience. Last semester, during a group programming project, I faced the challenge of working with unmotivated teammates and limited resources. Despite not having a laptop and little help from my group, I took responsibility and completed the project on my own. It was a difficult yet rewarding experience that reinforced my strong mindset and determination. Whether it’s leading a team, contributing to my community, or overcoming personal challenges, I’ve learned that hard work, kindness, and faith can help me succeed in any endeavor.</p>
